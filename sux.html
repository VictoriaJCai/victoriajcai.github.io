 <section class="What">
	<h2>What's the problem</h2>
	<p>As ScheduleUX has grown, the Admin Portal has fallen behind and no longer meets the business' needs for managing users, restricting access to customer data, and supporting the day-to-day activities of employees.</p>
 </section>
 <section class="Specifics">
	<h2>Specific Issues</h2>
	<p>1.Offering promotional benefits and addressing account issues for customers is unacceptably time-consuming (generally 3-5 minutes per task).</p>
    <p>2.When an employee makes changes to an account, those changes are done by directly editing database-objects, which is risky and highly error-prone.</p>
    <p>3.As there is only one 'employee role' in the admin system, employees share unrestricted access to all user-data, which is a SOC compliance issue.</p>
    <p>4.Marketing and growth efforts are being postponed out of fear that ScheduleUX lacks the capacity to keep up with an unexpected influx of service requests.</p>
 </section>
 <section class="Why are they problems?">
	<h2>Why are they problems?</h2>
	<p>1.Display the right Data. Each role has different data-access needs, and functionality-requirements necessary to perform their job duties. All employees utilize the same portal but have differing access to data and features depending on their roles.</p>
    <p>2.Data security. Our goal of protecting user privacy and in adherence to data-security best practices, access is restricted to user-information and functionality except where it is specifically necessary for performing the duties associated with each employee's role.</p>
    <p>3.Time, effort, and efficiency.  The Admin Portal supports employees by streamlining workflows. How easy is it for an admin to navigate through the site? (Steps) How long does it take to locate a user? (Time) How long does it take to extend their service?(Time) How difficult is it to perform an action in adding a note? (Steps) </p>
    <p>4.Chance to make an error.  Each role involved in customer-management needs access to the customers' data to verify their identities and to ensure they are reviewing or modifying the correct user-accounts. There needs to be validation of input.</p>
 </section>
 <section class="My Work">
	<h2>My Work</h2>
	<p>1.Determined business requirement.</p>
    <p>2.Clarified admin's roles, responsibilities, and restrictions. </p>
    <p>3.Defined each admin's tasks. </p>
    <p>4.Decided what data was shown and could be modified to each role.</p>
    <p>5.Produced lo-fis for user list, view/edit user. </p>
 </section>
 <section class="Outcomes">
	<h2>Outcomes</h2>
	<p>Reduced task-completion time for typical tasks by 83% on desktop, and by as much as 95% for admins using mobile devices.</p>
    <p>Eliminated the opportunity for input errors when making changes to user accounts by developing a UI with appropriate controls for every use-case.</p>
    <p>Streamlined workflows to increase capacity for ScheduleUX admins, eliminating the need for additional staffing.</p>
    <p>Improved data-security with role-based limitations on customer-data access and by restricting access to hosting accounts and databases.</p>
